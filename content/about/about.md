# Hello,
my name is David, and I work as a software engineer in the Austrian city of **Graz**.
I'm currently enrolled in TU Graz's **Software Engineering & Management** programme.
In addition, I work as a Golang Engineer at [Anexia](https://anexia.com/).

I enjoy using code to design and create products of excellent quality.
I always use state-of-the-art technology to achieve the best results.
Naturally, this involves a lot of passion and a lot of openness to self-paced learning.

In addition to having a tech background, I adore Austria's natural beauty.
Additionally, I am fascinated by all branches of science, especially astrophysics.
I read a lot of books on a variety of topics in order to stay informed.
